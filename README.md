# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIALS_DATA

I did this project in collaboration with UNP. The Popular Movies Dashboard provides insights into movie trends, audience preferences, and performance metrics. It analyzes the total number of movies, their genre distribution, and highlights the top-rated and most popular movies. The dashboard tracks average ratings, rating distribution, and user engagement, helping to identify which movies receive the most reviews. Additionally, it explores popular tags and genres, showing trends over time and the relevance of different themes. The financial aspect is covered by analyzing highest-grossing movies, revenue trends, and how ratings impact box office performance. This data-driven approach helps in understanding what makes a movie successful, enabling better content recommendations and business decisions in the film industry.
